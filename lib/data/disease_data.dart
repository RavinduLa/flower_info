  Disease(
    name: "Botrytis blight",
    look: "Botrytis Leaf Blight is a fungal disease that mainly affects plants in the allium family, specifically, white onions.",
    cause: "BLB usually occurs as a result of overwatering or extended periods of damp, rainy weather. The longer the leaves remain wet, the more pervasive the outbreak.",
    treat: "Plant onions in well-drained soil. Water early in the day so the leaves can dry before cool evening temperatures set in.",
    prevent: "To scale back the severity of Botrytis Leaf Blight, consider the following: Contaminated leaves and onion cuttings should be discarded and destroyed.",

  Disease(
    name: "Powdery mildew",
    look: "Powdery mildew is nice and easy to identify. Afflicted plants look as if they have been dusted in powdered sugar. Powdery mildew starts out in circular spots that can appear on any part of the plant, but usually the upper parts of leaves.",
    cause: "Powdery mildew likes a unique combination of shade and warm, dry conditions. It's a fungal disease that can seemingly-randomly appear.",
    treat: "Powdery mildew is best treated with fungicides. It is recommended to spray any affected plants down with fungicide, including neem oil and lime-sulfur. If you'd prefer a more natural option, baking soda can also do the trick. Just mix roughly 1 tsp of baking soda with 1 quart of water.",
    prevent: "Powdery mildew is most effectively prevented by providing plenty of sunlight. Air circulation is also important, so don't let any debris collect around your plants. Just these two things will go a long way to preventing powdery mildew!",
